            <p>Snapchat is very well known for it's ability to enable users to maintain "streaks" with other users. On top of that feature, it also has thousands of different filters, a story feature where you can share parts of your life with all of your friends at once, and an explore page where you can view content from other users. On top of sending images, Snapchat allows you to also share short videos that can also have filters applied to them and result in some of the funniest content. </p>
          <p>Of course what has been mentioned above is only a small sampling of what Snapchat has to offer. Beyond what has already been mentioned it has features like its ability to chat with other users, snap memories, the snap map, geofilters, lenses, etc.</p>
